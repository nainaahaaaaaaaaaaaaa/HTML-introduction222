    <h3> <strong> Graphic Design</strong></h3>
    <p>
        I’m deeply passionate about graphic design, and I love the process of laying out different designs<br>
         to bring creative ideas to life. Whether it’s crafting posters, branding materials, or other visuals, <br>
         I enjoy playing with layouts, colors, and typography to make each project unique. I’m always exploring <br>
          new techniques and tools to improve my skills, and I take pride in creating designs that are both<br>
           functional and visually appealing. Designing is more than just a skill for me—it’s something I truly love to do.</p>
           The top software tools that I love to use are:<br>

    </h3>
    <p>
         I take pride in my ability to communicate clearly and effectively. Whether it's through speaking or writing.<br>
     I can express my ideas in a way that's easy to understand. I enjoy collaborating with others, whether it’s in <br>
     a team or when presenting ideas . I’m good at listening and making sure everyone is on the same page, which help<br>
     s in solving problems and achieving common goals. Being able to articulate thoughts clearly is something I<br>
      value, and it allows me to build strong, positive relationships with the people I work with.<br>

    feeling overwhelmed. This helps me stay productive and deliver quality work, even under tight deadlines.<br>
